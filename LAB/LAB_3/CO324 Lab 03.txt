Exercise 1:
Compile and run the given code. FrameServer.java and FrameClient.java
Explain what will happen if the client did not append the delimiter at the end of the message.

	If client did not append the delimiter at the end of the code server cannot print the sent message because that
	the server is looking for delimeter to end the sentence and it checks until it finds the delimeter and does not
	print until it found.

Explain what will happen if the user decided to have a dash (-) character in one of the messages entered.
	
	The server defined delimeter is dash (-) so if the user enters a dash at the end of the message it will work fine.
	Because server finds the delimeter that it is looking for at the end and print the message.

Exercise2:
1.What is the delimiter used for framing in the following code?

	Socket clientSocket = serverSocket.accept();
	Scanner in = new Scanner ( cilentSocket.getInputStream() );
	String message;
	message = in.next();
	if(message != null)
		System.out.println("message: "+message);

	Inthis code there isn't any delimeter defined. So the client automatically get the new line charactor (\n), space and carrage return as delimeters or terminating charactors.

2.Now consider the FrameClient2.java code. This client has been written in order to allow a user to send
multi-line message ( i.e. a text message that has newline characters in the middle ). The corresponding 
server is FrameServer2.java. Edit both server and client such that the user could enter any message with 
any character in the message. (Hint : Use non-printing characters for this exercise. A non-printing character
is a character that a user cannot enter through the keyboard. For an example, “end of text” character 
(with the Unicode value 3) cannot be typed in with a keyboard. You can add this character to a string as 
follows:String line = “hello world” + '\u0003'; )

	In this code we have to append the new delimeter after client enter 'End' at the client code and set the server code to
	check the delimeter which append by the client code.
